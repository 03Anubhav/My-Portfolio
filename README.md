# My-Portfolio
Created a personal website to showcase my agricultural engineering projects, including a precision seed sower. Integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to highlight my skills in both web development and agricultural technology. Featured detailed project descriptions, including design, implementation, and outcomes.
